The 12 Best Stocks to Buy for a Whole New Year of Returns in 2021,finance.yahoo.com,"Back in July, I recommended seven of the best stocks to buy for 2021 and beyond. As a group, they’ve done very well over the past three months. For instance, Livongo Health was acquired by Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) on Oct. 30 for $11.33 per share in cash and 0.592 times shares in Teladoc. 
But looking for a bit of a twist on my stock selection process, I’ve decided that this list will be based on the first letter of all 12 months. That means my stock pick for January will have a corporate name beginning with J, then an F for February and so forth. 
All 12 will also have a market capitalization of $2 billion or more and positive free cash flow for the trailing 12 months. By this time next year, I’m confident that my picks, on the whole, won’t disappoint.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips


					7 Cheap Stocks Ready for Big Gains in 2021				

So, without further ado, here are my 12 best stocks for a brand new year:
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 
Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE:FIS) 
McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) 
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) 
MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) 
Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI)
Jeld-Wen Holding (NYSE:JELD)
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB)
Otis Worldwide (NYSE:OTIS)
NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)
Dollar General (NYSE:DG)

Stocks to Buy: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com
	
Johnson & Johnson represents the month of January on my list of best stocks to buy for 2021. Right now, it’s having a sideways kind of year in the markets. Its year-to-date (YTD) total return through Dec. 4 is just 2.6%. 
Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow (FCF) of $18.3 billion and a current enterprise value (EV) of over $399 billion, JNJ’s FCF yield is a reasonable 4.7%. It might not be value territory — I consider anything above 8% to be cheap — but it’s pretty darn good. 
As InvestorPlace colleague Faisal Humayun recently stated, JNJ stock has an excellent product offering. 
“From a business perspective, the company provides diversified exposure to the segments of consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The company’s pharmaceutical segment growth for Q3 2020 was impressive with most therapeutic areas delivering strong numbers.”
Not to mention, JNJ is still very much in the Covid-19 vaccine race. That suggests that 2021 could be a breakout year for this Dividend Aristocrat.  

Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)
Source: Maryna Pleshkun/Shutterstock.com
	
Next on my list of best stocks to buy is Fidelity National Information Services, representing the month of February. This payment processor is having an underwhelming year relative to the U.S. markets as a whole. Currently, FIS stock has a YTD total return of just over 7%, about half the markets’ rate of return in 2020.   
Based on a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $2.57 billion and an enterprise value of $109.75 billion, though, Fidelity National’s FCF yield is very decent at 3.8%.
You won’t find a lot of commentary from InvestorPlace contributors on this stock, despite the fact it does have a part to play in the technology side of the financial services industry. 
However, on Nov. 19, the Florida-based company announced that it earned the top spot for the sixth consecutive year in a ranking of 100 leading providers of risk and compliance technology. 
Additionally, while Covid-19 has slowed the rate at which FIS can process transactions, it still has managed to generate organic revenue growth during its third quarter of 1% to about $3.2 billion. The company also increased adjusted net income by 18% to $887 million.


					7 Growth Stocks Flying Under the Radar				

So, this is not a glamorous stock but its services are certainly in demand. 

McDonald’s (MCD)
Source: CHALERMPHON SRISANG / Shutterstock.com
	
To represent March for the coming year, I’ve picked the golden arches of MCD stock. Like many of the names on this list, McDonald’s has an okay year going, up 7.11% YTD today. That’s better than many of its restaurant peers, but it’s trailing the U.S. markets as a whole.  
Thanks to Covid-19 shutdowns, McDonald’s trailing 12-month free cash flow isn’t nearly as strong as it usually is, now at $4.25 billion. Currently, the industry leader has an FCF yield of 2.7% based on an enterprise value of about $205 billion. 
Despite operating in one of the hardest-hit industries, McDonald’s has continued to look beyond the novel coronavirus, continually finding ways to transform its business without upsetting the core customer. 
For instance, the company recently gave Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) the cold shoulder by announcing it would be testing a line of meatless alternatives in 2021, including the McPlant burger. Interestingly — despite developing the plant-based burger with Beyond Meat’s input — the fast-food company decided to go its own way. 
The decision to go on its own was a result of two reasons. First, MCD didn’t want to alienate its meat-loving customers. Secondly, it’s not a fan of letting licensees and other brands into its house. Beyond Meat would have surely taken some shine off of the Golden Arches. 
McDonald’s has had a tough time, but it always bounces back. That makes it one of the best stocks to buy for the upcoming year.

Adobe (ADBE)
Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com
	
Adobe, the mastermind behind the PDF and so much more, is my pick for the month of April. It’s having an excellent year in the markets right now, with a YTD total return of over 47%. That’s considerably better than both its software peers and the U.S. markets as a whole, making it one of the best stocks to buy right now.  
Adobe’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $4.9 billion, while its enterprise value is nearly $232 billion for an FCF yield of 2.1%. Both its enterprise value and EV-EBITDA multiple have also risen dramatically in the past five years. In 2016, the company had an enterprise value of $48 billion and an EV-EBITDA of 26.1. Presently, the stock has an EV-EBITDA multiple of 48.3.


					7 Stocks to Sell for December				

In early February, I said ADBE stock was all but certain to hit $400 in 2020. It did and then some. Moving forward, I think it’s all but certain to hit $500 — perhaps $600 — in 2021.  

MercadoLibre (MELI)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
	
MercadoLibre is sometimes referred to as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America, although it more closely resembles Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). For my list of best stocks to buy in 2021, it represents the month of May. 
Currently, MELI stock is having a fantastic year in the markets with a YTD total return of over 170%. Like Adobe, MercadoLibre is faring far better than both its internet retail peers and U.S. markets as a whole.  
This company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $810 million, while its enterprise value is almost $76 billion for an FCF yield of 1.1%. While that might seem low, MercadoLibre’s free cash flow has never been higher. Likewise, its revenues are on fire and growing like weeds. True to the Amazon comparison, this name will also probably see exponential growth in its free cash flow over the next few years. 
I’ve been a fan of the company since as far back as 2013, when it was trading around $120. At the time, I argued that it had a dominant position in Latin American e-commerce and its stock would benefit from that. 
As I write this, shares are priced around $1,555 and moving higher in 2021.

Johnson Controls (JCI)
Source: Shutterstock
	
There aren’t a lot of great companies with a J as the first letter in their name. There are even fewer with strong free cash flow. Nonetheless, Johnson Controls represents the month of June on my list of best stocks to buy.
Interestingly, while it’s only generally matching the YTD performance of the U.S. markets as a whole, JCI stock is doing better in 2020 than it has in some time. Over the past five years, it’s delivered an annualized total return for shareholders of about 9.1%, well below the markets. 
However, up almost 14% over the past three months, the company appears to be gathering speed heading into 2021. 
In early November, Johnson Controls also announced its fourth-quarter results, which were excellent despite the challenging business environment. In fiscal 2020, it had sales of $22.3 billion and net income of $1.69 billion, flat to a year earlier. 
That’s not bad for a company that manufactures, installs and services products designed for offices, industrial properties and other types of commercial real estate — all of which were hurt by the pandemic. 
Johnson Controls’ trailing 12-month free cash flow is nearly $1.8 billion, while its enterprise value is about $39 billion for an FCF yield of 5.3%. 


					The 7 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for December				

I view JCI as a nice stock for risk-averse investors who also like a little dividend income — its dividend yield is 2.27% at the moment.  

Jeld-Wen Holding (JELD)
Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com
	
By far the smallest of the 12 names on this list, JELD stock has a market cap of $2.42 billion. This maker of windows and doors represents the month of July on my best stocks to buy list. 
Back in late January of 2017, Jeld-Wen went public at $23 a share. 
Now, though — if you bought shares in its IPO and are still holding — you’ve made almost no money on your investment. Year-to-date, it’s got a total return of just 2.7%, well below the booming returns of its building products and equipment industry peer group. Those stocks have mostly benefited from Covid-19. 
The company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow is $250 million, while its enterprise value is $3.8 billion for an FCF yield of 11.3%.
However, on Nov. 3, the company reported third-quarter results that were better than analyst expectations. On the top-line, revenue was $1.11 billion, $2 million higher than the consensus estimate. On the bottom line, it had adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents, eight cents higher than analyst expectations. President and CEO Gary Michel said the following:
“Consumers’ focus on their homes, coupled with our strategy to deliver profitable market share with key customers, is driving increased demand for products in both residential new construction and repair and remodel channels.”
As the focus remains on homes in 2021, I expect Jeld-Wen to snap out of its funk and do well.

Apple (AAPL)
Source: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com
	
For August, the famous maker of the iPhone is the next pick of this list. However, if there were a month beginning with the letter B, I’d recommend Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) because it’s a much better value play and happens to own almost 965 million shares of AAPL stock. 
Apple’s YTD total return is over 66%, which sounds rather ordinary, given its almost 30% annualized total return over the past 15 years. I’d take it every day of the week. 
As for free cash flow and enterprise value, they are almost $73.4 billion and $2.1 trillion, respectively. That’s an FCF yield of 3.5%, an excellent valuation for one of the world’s largest public companies. 
Put simply, Apple has become so much more than a maker of smartphones. 
According to AppleInsider.com, Apple’s new “M1-equipped Mac mini” has jumped to the number one position in sales in the Japanese market for desktop computers — after only two weeks of availability. Further, Apple now has a 27% market share in Japan, up from roughly 13% a year earlier. 


					10 Best Stocks to Buy for Investors Under 30				

So, I don’t think you can go wrong owning Apple over the long haul. Clearly, it’s one of the best stocks to buy for the coming year.

SVB Financial (SIVB)
Source: Shutterstock
	
Next, representing the month of September is my favorite U.S. bank. SVB Financial is the holding company that operates Silicon Valley Bank, the Santa Clara-based financial institution that focuses on entrepreneurs and innovators. 
Right now, it’s having an awesome year compared to peers in regional banking. While SIVB stock is up nearly 43% YTD, most of its peers are down. It’s also leaving the U.S. markets in the dust. That said, I won’t bother noting the free cash flow for this name because it’s not meaningful for banking institutions. Instead, the balance sheet matters most. 
SIVB reported Q3 2020 results that included earnings per share of $8.47, almost double the $4.42 per share it earned the year prior. The president and CEO of SVB Financial, Greg Becker, noted:
“We had an exceptional quarter driven by outstanding balance sheet growth, higher core fee income, strong investment banking revenue, solid credit resulting in a reduction of reserves, and outsized equity gains related to client IPO activity […] These results reflect the resilience of our markets and our ability to execute effectively.”
SIVB was on my 2013 list of the five best stocks to buy for the next 20 years, right up there with Amazon. I think you owe it to yourself to check it out in 2021.

Otis Worldwide (OTIS)
Source: rafapress/shutterstock.com
	
Back in early April, this elevator company spun off from United Technologies, which merged with Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) to become one of the world’s largest aerospace and defense companies.
While it won’t have a full 12-month track record until April, this representative for the month of October has risen 43.5% YTD, suggesting 2021 could deliver an excellent performance. 
In the trailing 12 months, Otis has a free cash flow of $1.47 billion and an enterprise value of about $33 billion. That makes for an FCF yield of 5.2%, so it’s reasonably priced. 
What’s more, the company’s third-quarter results demonstrate that it’s holding its own during the pandemic. Top-line organic sales fell 1.2% in Q3 2020 to $3.3 billion while its operating profit grew 7% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. Also, operating margins increased 120 basis points to 15.4%. 
In November, Toronto-based portfolio manager Christine Poole made OTIS stock one of her three top picks on BNN Bloomberg’s Market Call, suggesting that its 17% global elevator market share makes it an excellent long-term investment with an excellent balance between sales and service, at 57% and 43% respectively.


					7 Value Stocks That May Come Back into Style After the Pandemic				

That makes it worthy of this best stocks to buy list for 2021. Can you say recurring revenue?

NextEra Energy (NEE)
Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com
	
Recently, I recommended this Florida-based utility company because of its renewable energy business, NextEra Energy Resources, which generates almost 40% of overall earnings. I maintain that NEE stock is one of the best stocks to buy for 2021, representing the month of November on this list.
NEE stock is a thing of beauty if consistent returns are your thing. YTD, it’s up about 20%. Over the past three-, five- and 10-year periods, it has annualized total returns of 25.1%, 26.8% and 20.5%, respectively. Let’s say it’s crushing its peers over any of those periods.
NextEra’s free cash flow in the trailing 12-months is $2.1 billion, while its enterprise value is $190 billion, for an FCF yield of -3.2%. So, it’s certainly not cheap.   
But InvestorPlace’s Mark Hake made an interesting observation on Nov. 25 when he suggested that NextEra would buy another utility with its strong share price. As Hake would agree, that’s Capital Allocation 101. 
NextEra made overtures to Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Evergy (NYSE:EVRG). Both rejected the offers. However, I’m sure something will shake out soon enough. Like Hake said, a bid might come with more cash. 
What I do know for certain is that NextEra is one of North America’s best-run utilities. 

Dollar General (DG)
Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com
	
Representing the final month of the year is Dollar General, the dollar-store discount chain with 17,000 locations in 46 states. It’s having another strong year, up almost 37% YTD. Combine that with a 10-year annualized total return of 20.8%, and you’ve got one heck of a long-term investment. 
As for trailing 12-month free cash flow, it has $3.1 billion, along with an enterprise value of nearly $64 billion. Right now, its FCF yield is 5.9%.
On Nov. 14, the company announced the opening of its 17,000th store in Fountain, Colorado. As a nice gesture to the community, Dollar General donated $17,000 to one of the local schools. In the company’s press release heralding the occasion, CEO Todd Vasos said:
“Since our founding more than 80 years ago, we have remained focused on helping customers save time and money.”
In my book, helping customers save time and money are the hallmarks of any successful business.
Back in November, I also recommended Dollar General as one of three stocks of relative values compared to Nio (NYSE:NIO), the Chinese electric vehicle maker. And while I like Nio long-term, it isn’t a name to buy for the short-term at current prices. DG stock is much more down-to-earth.

As long as working folk need to save money, Dollar General’s business remains a solid bet. In turn, that makes it one of the best stocks to buy going into the uncertainty of 2021.

7 Tech Stocks That Could Be the Future FAANG,finance.yahoo.com,"A few months ago, I began prodding around the idea of, “What are the future FAANG stocks?” We’ve seen Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other tech stocks swell from modest winners to worldwide behemoths. These stocks went from $100 billion to $1 trillion in market capitalization. So many people talk about what it would be like if we had bought Apple in the 1980s or Amazon in 1999. While anyone who did and was able to hold on until now is ridiculously rich, they also sat through a ton of volatility. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Further, investors could have waited until after Apple’s iPhone moment or Amazon’s clear dominance of e-commerce and still made a 10x or more return on their investment. Don’t believe me? Apple is up over 1,000% over the past decade, while Amazon is up 1,760%. Over just the last five years — when it was absurdly clear these two were established leaders — Apple and Amazon are up 463% and 442%, respectively. That led me to ponder, what are the next tech stocks that could become new FAANG leaders? Specifically, I am looking for companies in the $50 billion to $300 billion market cap range that can go to $400 billion to $1 trillion or more. It’s an admittedly wide range, but who cares — these winners are right under our noses. Let’s look at seven tech stocks: 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) Tech Stocks to Buy for Future Gains: PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $295 billion Many investors have continued to underestimate PayPal. When it comes to FAANG tech stocks in their younger years, that seems to be a staple observation of them as well. However, PayPal has found a way to become a payment juggernaut. While sending money to friends and family is free and convenient, that’s simply one part of the ecosystem. The company also makes a sliver of sales when involving another business or merchant. It’s become a safe, trusted and convenient way for businesses to sell online or to make subscriptions a piece of cake. PayPal’s acquisition of Venmo and Honey have only added to those layers of engagement, while e-commerce will continue to be the main catalyst behind its growth. For those looking at tech stocks, the power and trend of e-commerce doesn’t need to be explained. Lastly, PayPal’s now in the cryptocurrency game, allowing customers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Etherium and Litecoin. Maybe PayPal won’t be able to collect its current “fee” — read: commission — on these transactions forever, based on how stock commissions vanished almost overnight in the brokerage industry. However, for now it should act as an additional growth catalyst. Bonus: At a $100 billion market cap, Square (NYSE:SQ) could also be a consideration as a member of new FAANG tech stocks in this respect. Salesforce (CRM) Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $206 billion. It should go without saying that given the massive gains the stock market has registered over the past nine months, the ideal scenario would be a sizable correction for several of the stocks on this list. However, that doesn’t apply to all of them. Take Salesforce for example. This company keeps on printing money as revenue continues to chug higher. For all the doubt that Salesforce has endured over the years, it has done quite well. It doesn’t seem like management plans on stopping, either. For instance, management is looking to generate $60 billion in revenue by 2034. Most recently, it aims to scoop up Slack (NYSE:WORK), growing its workstation presence and scaling up its fight against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 8 Cheap Stocks to Buy With Your Next Stimulus Check As we are talking about pullbacks, Salesforce is a great example. At the recent low, shares were 25% off the highs. That seems like a great opportunity for a company that continually sports 20%-plus revenue growth. Nvidia (NVDA) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $335 billion Admittedly a bit larger than what we were looking for, Nvidia needs to be included on this list. Almost every major technological trend is growing in demand. More internet traffic is creating strain in the cloud, increasing demand for edge-cloud computing. More data is creating more need for datacenters. Increasing self-driving vehicle capabilities demand more computing power. Better computers demand better graphics. The list goes on and on and Nvidia is there at every turn. The company’s products cater to multiple end markets with impressive secular growth. That’s why, despite the pandemic, Nvidia saw such an extreme acceleration in both earnings and revenue. Its savvy M&A strategy has allowed it to add high-quality names like Mellanox at reasonable valuations. Now Nvidia is going after Arm, a massive $40 billion deal. Nvidia is already nearing an unstoppable state, but with Arm it would be a juggernaut. From a pure antitrust perspective, Nvidia should be fine. However, this “juggernaut” position might cause some hiccups. Either way, this is a high-quality name that will only grow in size over time. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $111.5 billion For Nvidia’s smaller sibling, we have Advanced Micro Devices. At about one-third the size, AMD has quickly climbed the ladder while drastically improving its financials. CEO Lisa Su has orchestrated one of the most impressive comeback stories in the stock market. Once left for dead, AMD was trading firmly below the $2 mark in 2016. Now sporting a 52-week high of $99-and-change, the leadership has been stellar. Like Nvidia, AMD is situated in multiple secular growth themes as rising demand in technology results in rising demand for AMD. Also like Nvidia, AMD saw a massive rise in revenue and profit during the pandemic. In one last final comparison to Nvidia, AMD is also working to close a large acquisition. In October, the company agreed to acquire Xilinx for $35 billion. 9 Stocks Selling at a Discount Right Now While it would require years worth of more growth, it’s not hard to imagine AMD growing to the size of Nvidia ($300 billion). Eventually clearing this level could put it on the lower end of the FAANG status in terms of its size. Roku (ROKU) Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $53 billion Roku is a tough one, because it’s certainly the smallest name on this list (by a lot) and it just went on a massive rally. Shares are up 90% over the past three months, as Roku has climbed from a market cap of just $28 billion to where it is today. Additionally, investors just don’t understand this company. They still think it’s going head-to-head with Amazon with its stick players. While that’s kind of true, the story behind Roku isn’t the hardware — it’s the platform. Roku doesn’t care if it’s making money on the hardware. Instead, its focus is on the platform, where it collects fees from content providers and on ad revenue from its free Roku channel. In that respect, growth continues to explode. Analysts expect roughly 50% revenue growth this year, followed by 40% growth in 2021 and 36% growth in 2022. Respectfully, I believe that may be conservative. Bulls will acknowledge that a pullback may be in order (and a potentially large one at that). However, I don’t think the top is in for Roku. For AMD I mentioned the “lower end of the FAANG status,” which would be Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Currently, that’s a $250 billion market cap and remember, NFLX is at a new high. I could see a scenario where Roku pulls back 20% to 25% — giving it a roughly $40 billion market cap — and ultimately roaring on to a $200-plus billion entity. Shopify (SHOP) Source: justplay1412 / Shutterstock.com Current Market Cap: $145 billion There is one problem with Shopify and several other names on this list: The rallies. While the massive rallies great for long-term investors, it makes the stocks susceptible to large pullbacks as well. If and when we get those declines, that’s investors’ opportunity to pounce. For Shopify, the bullish reasoning is multifold. First, Shopify is riding a much large trend — e-commerce — and therefore will continue to benefit from robust growth. When the coronavirus hit, sales were not negatively impacted. Instead, merchants flocked to its platform, driving Shopify’s revenue higher. Second, it’s building out the anti-Amazon business platform — giving merchants big and small power and control of the customer experience. Now the reward here is massive, as Shopify builds out multiple business segments likes shipping, credit, Shopify Pay and others. However, the risk is present as well. That is, can these companies that crave independence from Amazon delivery quality experiences for the customer? In the end, businesses and merchants are at least willing to try. In December 2019 I said investors could buy Shopify despite its lofty valuation. My argument centered on its valuation, saying this name could go from a $40 billion market cap to a $100 to $120 billion market cap in a decade. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times It was not obvious that the more than tripling in its value would take place in just a few months. In the long, long run, it’s not hard to imagine this name being significantly higher. Adobe Systems (ADBE) Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Current market cap: $228 billion Last but not certainly not least is Adobe. This company does a lot more than just Flash or Photoshop. It’s become a mainstay in e-commerce while also becoming a beacon in the graphics, digital and creative landscape. Find me a freelance graphic designer who’s not using Adobe. The stock has quietly racked up enormous gains as well. Adobe is up 140% over the past three years and 430% over the past five years. Over the last decade, the stock has rallied more than 1,300%, as its market cap was around $16 billion just 10 years ago. That’s some impressive action and Adobe doesn’t show many signs of letting up. Analysts expect double-digit earnings and revenue growth this year and next year, while the company gross margins remain solidly above 85%. While its top-line margins have been steady, its bottom-line profit margins have been soaring. Adobe is quickly yet quietly becoming a technology juggernaut right in front of us. Like some others on this list, the stock has been consolidating nicely over the past six months or so. Let’s see if this name can resolve to the upside.

$10 Billion Reasons to Start Buying Intel Stock Now,finance.yahoo.com,"I am not usually a fan of buyback programs, especially not as a reason to chase a stock. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced this week that it intends to buy back $10 billion worth of its own stock. This may be a reason to start buying into INTC stock for of two reasons. First, it''s cheap and recovering so investors would not be chasing it. And second, I think the intent of the buyback from management is to project confidence in the company''s future. You don''t buy an asset unless you believe it will be improving, so they may have good plans forward.Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com Usually there is a stigma that comes with buybacks because it could suggest that its managers have no better ideas than this. Case in point, you never see Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) doing this because it invests every penny into future businesses.Intel here is trying to align the Wall Street risk profile for the company with the reality of its position among investors. Simply put, there is no respect for this formidable company especially if you compare it to Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI can''t fault the critics for not liking it because management has been very disappointing for a long while. INTC Stock Has a Ton of ValueI like the underdog, and right now, all eyes are focused on AMD and NVDA stock. I want to bet that INTC stock will make a comeback, but I don''t expect a very well defined explosion, so I will need patience to profit.  * 7 Penny Stocks to Buy Right Now As Trends Catalyze Opportunity The best thing that Intel has going for it is how little value investors give it now. It has a trailing-12-month price-earnings ratio of 8.9. Compare that to 156 and 91 for AMD and Nvidia respectively. It looks like there is a lot of room to grow.Speaking of growth, the current INTC stock price only has three years worth of sales baked into it now, that is four times cheaper than AMD and nine times cheaper than NVDA. Clearly INTC needs a catch-up trade because it also pays a 2.7% dividend to boot.On paper, this is the slam-dunk chip stock to buy. But as they say, price is truth and so far the investors are not buying it. This makes it a perfect dark horse to bet on for the next two years at least. This is not meant to be an overnight win so I consider this an investment not a trade. The idea is to stash the stock away and forget about it for a while.There are other ways of mitigating the risk, and the easiest thing to do is to only take a partial position. This would leave room to add on more dips. This is important because there is extrinsic risk from the stock market in general being so high in the face of tough times. There Is More than One Way to Get Long a StockSource: Charts by TradingView My favorite way to build room for error while taking bullish positions is to use options. There I can pretty much define a risk level that suits my tolerance. Moreover, I can make it so that I don''t even need a rally to win. In this case this is important because INTC stock trades more like a bank than a fast-moving chip stock. It has tons of value, so the dips should be shallow, but it can''t sustain a rally to save its life.To get long the traditional way, investors would need to buy shares at $49 with absolutely no room for error. Then they would need a rally to win. Instead I prefer selling the Jan $43 put and collect $2 for it. This is my maximum profit if it stays above my strike. Else I own the shares at $43 and I break even at $41. The advantage here is that I can still profit even if the INTC stock falls another 13% from here. The bad thing about this strategy is that I have a limited upside potential. But to fix this problem I would also buy Intel April 2021 $55 calls or call spread. This would add the upside element back in and make the entry cost much cheaper than a simple buy order.Timing is important, and for this one it''s best to delay buying calls until after the bulls break out from $52.30. There is a giant gap there and it usually takes some work to get through it. I can start by selling the puts now and then add the upside call position later.Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. Join his live chat room for free here.

"Barron''s Post-Christmas Picks And Pans: Alibaba, Apple, Intel, Pool, Yelp And More",finance.yahoo.com,"* This weekend''s Barron''s cover story offers six travel and leisure stock picks for a rebound in demand.  * Other featured articles examine China''s crackdown on tech giants, the iPhone maker''s interest in automobiles, and how Barron''s 2020 stocks picks have fared.  * Also, the prospects for a semiconductor giant, airline stocks, a swimming pool stock and more.Cover story '"Try These 6 Travel and Leisure Stocks to Play a Vaccine-Driven Rebound in Demand'" by Lawrence C. Strauss indicates that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout will boost some companies and sectors sooner than others. Cruise stocks like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE: RCL), lodging and casino stocks like MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) and others have been on a tear.Daren Fonda''s '"5 Airline Stocks That Could Cruise Even Higher'" shows that airline stocks have climbed as vaccines lifted hopes, and they are no longer bargains. A few stocks look appealing, however. See whether American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV) are worth checking out now.In '"China''s Crackdown on Alibaba Probably Won''t Stop There,'" Al Root and Liz Moyer point out that Beijing is targeting e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) and its co-founder. Regulators there are likely to go after other companies too.The widespread shutdown of indoor dining weighed heavily on Yelp Inc (NYSE: YELP) in 2020. So says '"A Cry for Yelp: A Reopening Play That''s Cheap'" by Eric J. Savitz. However, the online recommendation site is growing its home and local service business. See how that is setting it up for a rebound in the coming year.In Teresa Rivas and Al Root''s '" This Swimming-Pool Stock Got a Covid Boost. It''s Still a Buy,'" the case is made that consumers who installed swimming pools during the pandemic will have to pay to maintain them for years to come. That is good news for Pool Corporation (NASDAQ: POOL), which distributes swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products.'"What Apple Would Want From the Auto Market'" by Eric J. Savitz suggests that, while speculation that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) could launch an autonomous car as soon as 2024 had the market abuzz this past week, the consumer electronics giant''s interest is more likely to be in services for the '"internet of cars.'"See also: Benzinga''s Bulls And Bears Of Christmas Week: Airbnb, Apple, Netflix, Nike, Tesla And MoreConnected fitness is all the rage, but stock prices of Apple, Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON) and others are plump, according to Jack Hough''s '"Fitness Stocks That Can Get Your Portfolio in Shape.'" Check out the alternatives featured in the article, and see whether Planet Fitness Inc (NYSE: PLNT) made the cut.In '"Here''s How Barron''s Stock Picks Did in 2020,'" Ben Levisohn claims that this year wasn''t the easiest for picking stocks or the direction of the market. One big mistake overshadowed the Barron''s calls. Was it Mcdonald''s Corp (NYSE: MCD)? Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX)? Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT)?Max A. Cherney''s '"Intel Had a Rough 2020. Next Year Isn''t Looking Much Better'" ponders why, unlike many of its rivals, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) stock has had a lousy year. It was it one of the worst-performing stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, while gains for other chip stocks continue to be a theme during the pandemic.Also in this week''s Barron''s:  * How small-caps have been too hot  * Barron''s annual forecasting challenge  * What the strength of China''s currency means for the United States  * Whether low yields of ESG bonds should deter investors  * Why initial public offerings will remain robust in 2021  * Whether the Federal Reserve is to blame for today''s low rates  * What the end of pandemic investing means for investors  * Whether the value stock rebound is a head fake  * What is fueling the recovery for luxury spirits  * The fate of the pandemic relief bill  * How Wall Street has responded to the historic hackAt the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities.Keep up with all the latest breaking news and trading ideas by following Benzinga on Twitter.Photo from Pixabay.

Will Micron Stock Reach $200 By 2022?,finance.yahoo.com,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios.We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) will reach $200 by 2022.Micron Stock Forecast Micron historically focused on providing DRAM for PCs and servers. The firm then expanded into the NAND flash memory market. The company increased its DRAM scale with the purchase of Elpida (completed in mid-2013) and Inotera (completed in December 2016).The company''s top competitors within the computer memory space include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ: AMD), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC).The Idaho-based computer memory and data storage producer continues to garner investor attention given its marked earnings growth.In the company''s first-quarter earnings report, earnings rose 62.5% over the past year to 78 cents per share, which beat the estimate by seven cents. Revenue of $5.77 billion rose by 12.23% from the same period last year, which beat the estimate of $5.73 billion.Survey SaysMicron trades around $79.45 at the time of publishing, off the 52-week low of $31, and 60% of Benzinga traders said Micron would indeed reach $200 per share by 2022.Respondents to the survey said the stock will increase over the next year given the increased demand for and sales of the company''s memory product solutions for the cloud server, enterprise, client, graphics and networking markets.Respondents emphasized Micron''s ultra-bandwidth solutions, which are known to deliver maximum bandwidth to feed client''s data-hungry workloads like high-performance computing, artificial intelligence systems and professional visualization workstations, will continue to spike in demand amid a transition to long-term remote working conditions.This survey was conducted by Benzinga in January 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.Photo credit: Mike Deal, FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Thinking About Buying Stock In FuelCell, Micron, Discovery Or Carnival?  * Will Nvidia Or Micron Stock Grow More By 2022?(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

3 Undervalued Stocks Looking Up in 2021,finance.yahoo.com,"It’s common knowledge that investing in undervalued stocks can generate some juicy returns over the long haul. However, the tricky part is investing in the right stocks at the right time. Investors often favor certain sectors over others and undervalued stocks tend to be in the latter category. Although 2021 is shaping up to be a bull cycle, there are still plenty of stocks trading below their value. Investors looking for a value play should consider buying these stocks as these gravitate towards the prices they are worth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 8 Cheap Stocks Under $20 That Could Double Here are three stocks that should be in for greater upside this year. Ford (NYSE:F) IBM (NYSE:IBM) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) Undervalued Stocks: Ford (F) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com In the Ford versus General Motors (NYSE:GM) wars, GM comes out on top this year for its recent venture into the autonomous vehicle space. However, there is plenty of evidence to prove that Ford is in a great position to close the performance gap in the coming months. One key tailwind is Rivian, the electric truck manufacturer. In 2019, Ford announced a minority stake in the electric truck start-up which is worth $28 billion. Although the company is yet to generate sales, its first vehicle is expected to come out later this year. This could bolster Ford’s bottom line as well. Adding to its partnership with Rivian, Ford is also expected to develop a line of electric vehicles in-house. In 2020, the automaker started distribution of its Mustang-Mach E and deliveries of the electric F-150 truck will begin this year. Ford has a market cap of just $45 million with free-cash-flow (FCF) of $3 billion. At this ratio, Ford is among the top undervalued stocks in the market. Under the hem of its new CEO Jim Farley, the company is primed for a major comeback this year. IBM (IBM) Source: Laborant / Shutterstock.com For the period ended in December, IBM stock took a hit after the company reported some poor quarterly results. A major reason for the 6% dip in revenue (year-over-year) was its slow adoption of cloud-based solutions. As expected, the Q4 earnings resulted in a massive sell-off bringing its share price back to March 2019 lows. Although this should deter investors from throwing their support behind the stock, IBM’s future prospects make it a great investment at its current price. For one, IBM’s recent transition to cloud solutions gives the company plenty of opportunities to grow in the coming years. According to CEO Arvind Krishna, hybrid cloud computing will be a $1 trillion opportunity for the company. This along with developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will translate to higher revenue levels in the second half of this year. Given the positive trends, I think IBM remains one of the most undervalued stocks on the market right now. Investors should get behind the investment before prices go higher. Intel Corporation (INTC) Source: Kate Krav-Rude / Shutterstock.com Another company that’s had a tough run this year is the chipmaker Intel. During its earlier than expected earnings call, CEO Pat Gelsinger stated that the company will continue to manufacture its chips in-house. This came as a disappointment to many investors who were hoping the company would outsource the manufacturing to improve internal efficiency. The news overshadowed Intel’s earnings, which beat analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings per share. Although the reaction to the earnings was a mixed bag there are still plenty of reasons to hold on to Intel stock. Intel stated that it will not outsource the production of its chips but there is a possibility it could do so for its other line of products like GPUs. As far as CPUs go, keeping the production of this in-house is capital intensive and could very-well lower its market competitiveness. However, there is good reason to believe that it can catch up to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), an emerging leader in the space. Last month, Intel introduced a new line of processors that will hit the market this year. As CPU sales spike, Intel will be able to capture a greater share of the market this year. Intel definitely has its challenges but in the grand scheme of things, the company has numerous opportunities to come out on top in 2021.

7 Long-Term Stocks To Buy You’ll Want To Hang Onto,finance.yahoo.com,"When you start hearing about day trading at volume, you know the markets have gotten frothy and buying and holding long-term stocks isn’t a top priority for investors. But times like these are precisely when it should be. Trying to time trades is tricky business, even for Wall Street bigshots who have been trading for decades with state of the art equipment and a lifetime of institutional knowledge – and occasionally an advanced degree in mathematics. Trying to outsmart these people or play their game over the long term might be entertaining, but if your goal is to make money, I wouldn’t bother. Finding companies with solid fundamentals in key industries and buying for the long-term might be boring, but it makes money.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Here are 7 long-term stocks to buy you’ll want to hang onto: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Clorox (NYSE:CLX) JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) Sony (NYSE:SNE) These companies deserve your attention for the future because of how well they’ve handled the past. Long-term Stocks To Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There are few companies that can turn into a global retail brand the way AMZN has done. From a humble online bookseller in the 1990s to market juggernaut in just three decades, Amazon has been on quite the journey. Now it’s hard for most Americans to imagine a day that doesn’t somehow involve an Amazon product. Whole Foods for grocery shopping (if you’re not buying supplies off its website). Prime for watching shows and movies. Of course, its bread-and-butter retail and logistics operations. And of course, cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services provides plenty of cash to keep all its new and existing ventures running. When the pandemic hit, everyone realized how valuable AMZN had become. But its value is much more now, as it holds a nearly $1.6 trillion market cap. It is kind of a one-stock index of the entire modern economy. If you’re a long-term bull on the U.S., AMZN is a long-term stock for you. Up 70% in the past year, its pace may vary but its continued growth isn’t in question. Clorox (CLX) Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com This company’s beginnings stand almost in direct opposition to that of AMZN. CLX made one product, bleach, for nearly 50 years and built a big business out of it. Now more than 100 years old, CLX has diversified its product line a bit, though not significantly. Now it has a portfolio of around 50 brands that are sold in over 100 countries. Reliable names like Glad, Handi Wipes, Liquid-Plumr, Pine-Sol and Tilex along with its titular Clorox line. This is a classic long-term US stock. During the pandemic, cleaning and disinfecting products have been in high demand at home and abroad. CLX stock remains rock solid. And that’s to be expected after growing through two World Wars, the Great Depression and everything else that has come its way. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Up 24% in the past 12 months, it’s still trading at a P/E of 21 — below the average forward P/E of the S&P 500 — with plenty of growth ahead. JD.com (JD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The growth of digital channels in the U.S. is mirrored in China, where its domestic market is almost an order of magnitude larger than U.S. market. The potential is huge. Also, the Chinese market operates a bit differently than the U.S. Large companies tend to work with each other to leverage their most important assets rather than try to compete head to head. But they also diversify. For example, JD is like the AMZN of China (and other Asian nations). It has expanded into logistics, AI, fintech and other sectors. Yet for all of its strength, it trades at one-tenth the market cap of AMZN and that’s after a 127% run in the past 12 months. Certainly there’s some trade risk here, as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges, but JD is far down that list. This is a top long-term stock for the China’s and Asia’s consumers. PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com This is the company that launched Elon Musk before he became the maverick CEO we all know today. Even back then Musk was a handful, getting deposed as CEO after a couple years but still holding more stock than anyone else when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchased PYPL in 2002. That became the seed capital for Musk’s later ventures. But beyond the personality, PYPL is a pioneer in electronic payments and now in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments with its Venmo app. Time and again Wall Street has dismissed PYPL as not having the kind of financial reputation or muscle to take on the big financial institutions in the digital space. And time and again, PYPL has proven them wrong. The past year has been a boon for PYPL’s model and has showed that big banks weren’t altogether ready for the quick and massive shift to digital. And PYPL now has credit services as well as other payment platforms. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon The stock is up over 113% in the past 12 months and it’s now here to stay. Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com We’re well ensconced in the Mobility Age at this point. By that I mean what started as the digital revolution has now moved to the point where wireless networks keep us connected nearly all the time, much to some people’s chagrin. But the fact is, despite the downsides, there are plenty of upsides too. And now that 5G telecom tech is upon us, data will be flowing even faster than before. One the beneficiaries and leaders in pushing digital mobility further is QCOM, one of the world’s leading telecom companies. Its business model is unique because it develops chips and telecom equipment but makes money licensing the technology for others to manufacture and also taking a cut of sales. Both U.S. and Chinese (and others) phone makers rely on state of the art QCOM chips, especially for 5G. QCOM just signed a new deal to rekindle relations with Chinese phone makers earlier this week. As long as mobility is a thing, this is a long-term stock to own. The stock is up 75% in the past 12 months, yet the stock is trading at a P/E of 35. Shopify (SHOP) Source: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com With unemployment nearing 6.7% and many states admitting that the pandemic has hampered their ability to accurately count the unemployed, there are a lot of Americans trying to figure out how to bring in a paycheck. Many have turned to driving Uber or Lyft, although passenger numbers are down significantly now as well. And taxis are even worse. That has led many to try their hands at turning their hobbies into businesses. And that’s where SHOP comes in. It’s a cloud-based platform that helps small and mid-sized business build out professional websites. The stock is up nearly 1000% over the past three years, and much of that has come in the past two years, as the economy has slowed. Vaccines may be on the way, and the government is working through another stimulus package, but the damage done to the economy has yet to be seen clearly given all the other issues facing the nation. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon This stock is up 167% in the past year and has plenty of potential growth ahead. Sony (SNE) Source: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com Launched in 1946 in Japan, SNE has been known to every generation since for various electronics. For decades, SNE made the best televisions in the world after launching the first all-transistor television in 1959 and taking the global television market by storm. Then came the video generation. Then the Walkman generation, when SNE defined personal, portable music. And now, it’s the PlayStation videogame system. Along the way, it has moved into the entertainment industry, on both the content and equipment sides. Its contributions to our electronic era are practically too numerous to list and Sony continues to be a formidable player. The thing is, it generally cuts a low profile. SNE stock is currently up more than 43% in the past 12 months, yet trades at a P/E below 15. This durable, quality electronics firm may not garner headlines, but it still is a revered and important brand, generation after generation.

"Affirm Raises $1.2B, Pricing Above Range In Hot IPO Market",finance.yahoo.com,"Online lender Affirm Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: AFRM) has raised roughly $1.2 billion by pricing its initial public offering (IPO) at $49 per share, above the expected range of $41 to $44, the company announced Tuesday. What Happened: Affirm is a fintech company providing installment loans to online shoppers and is led by PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL) co-founder Max Levchin.The IPO values Affirm at $11.9 billion based on outstanding shares. Its fully diluted valuation, including options and restricted stock units, is about $15 billion, as per Bloomberg.The company is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol '"AFRM'" on Wednesday.Affirm is one of the first in a list of several companies to go public this year. Affirm''s IPO shows that the market is hot for tech companies, continuing from 2020, which saw businesses raise more than 9 billion.Affirm was founded in 2012 by Max Levchin. The PayPal co-founder is the second-biggest shareholder in Affirm, according to filings.Why It Matters: Affirm is popular among online merchants, with more than 6,500 using the platform according to the company''s prospectus.Affirm offers a '"buy now, pay later'" product that appeals to online shoppers for buying big-ticket items and spread out payments. In return, Affirm charges merchants a fee, the Financial Times reports. Affirm makes most of its money from merchant fees, which results in customers paying zero interest. It also offers interest-based loans without late fees.A chunk of Affirm''s business comes from sales through fitness company Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: PTON), accounting for 28% of its 12-month revenue through June 2020.Affirm clocked a revenue of $510 million for 12 months through June 2020 and reported losses of $113 million.A boom in online shopping has led to the popularity of Affirm. However, it''s a competitive space with established players like PayPal offering similar buy now, pay later options.Related News: 10 Of 2020''s Top Performing IPOsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Global Markets Face Downward Pressure, Bitcoin Shows Resistance Near K  * Boeing Delivered 157 Aircrafts In 2020, Its Worst Showing In Decades(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

Bitcoin Surge Renews Enthusiasm For Blockchain ETF,finance.yahoo.com,"Bitcoin''s 2020 ascent is extending into the new year with the largest digital currency by market value ascending above $33,000 on Jan. 2.What Happened: After more than quadrupling last year, bitcoin''s market value last weekend was hovering around $610 billion. Said differently, if the cryptocurrency were a publicly-traded domestic company, it would be the seventh-largest component in the S&P 500.All that enthusiasm made its way to blockchain exchange-traded funds, a group of thematic ETFs that debuted several years ago around the time of bitcoin''s initial epic surge, one that results in a similarly epic slide. One member of that group is the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (NYSE: BLOK).Why It''s Important: Until a dedicated bitcoin ETF is approved in the U.S., funds like BLOK can give investors some synthetic crypto exposure. Data confirm BLOK is responsive to bitcoin moves as the Amplify ETF surged 86.56% last year and its trough-to-peak move was nearly a triple.'"BLOK is an actively managed ETF that seeks to provide total return by investing at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of companies actively involved in the development and utilization of blockchain technologies,'" according to the issuer.Data suggest some investors are embracing the notion of BLOK as something of a bitcoin proxy. In mid-December, Amplify put out a press release stating the ETF topped $250 million in assets under management. Now, just a few days shy of its third birthday, BLOK is a $361.55 million ETF.'"As applications using blockchain technology continue to expand, we believe BLOK offers investors an attractive way to participate in this growing market segment,'"  said Amplify CEO Christian Magoon. '"From food safety, to cryptocurrency to the issuance of sovereign debt, blockchain technology is impacting the lives and portfolios of investors around the world each day. We believe BLOK''s unique set of holdings and actively managed approach will continue to distinguish it in the marketplace in terms of assets under management and shareholder returns.'"What''s Next: Investors should note that BLOK is NOT a bitcoin ETF. It''s an equity-based fund, though some of its holdings, such as Square (NYSE: SQ) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), are increasingly levered to the crypto trade.Overall, BLOK holds 54 stocks, roughly 42% of which are technology names and nearly 23% of which hail from the financial services sector. None of those holdings exceed weights of 4.93%.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 3 New ETFs For 2021: Rookies Ready To Come Of Age  * VanEck Gives Bitcoin ETF Another Go(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

7 Cheap Stocks That Can’t Wait for 2021,finance.yahoo.com,"Everyone loves a good bargain, right? Well, when the market endured that painful selloff in March, it drove down stock valuations. At the time, though, volatility was so high and there were so many unknowns that it was hard to pile into names. So, are there still cheap stocks to buy now? 
The short answer? Yes. That brutal second-quarter decline created a lot of cheap names. But in many cases, it’s been hard to tell what’s cheap and what’s a trap. That’s because we didn’t know how businesses would react to the new environment.
As we near the end of 2020, though — with all major U.S. stock indices at new highs — it’s pretty clear the market is doing fine. And there are still a number of cheap stocks out there, waiting to fetch a bid from buyers. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips


					Grading 10 of 2020''s Hottest SPACs in Preparation for the New Year				

I recently looked at some cheap picks that have become not-so-cheap over the past month or so. So, let’s see if we can find some other bargains now.
Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
AT&T (NYSE:T)
Gogo (NASDAQ:GOGO)
Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA)
Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY)
Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)

Cheap Stocks to Buy: Alibaba (BABA)
Source: testing / Shutterstock.com
	
When someone clicks on an article about bargain stocks to buy, they probably don’t think they’ll see a high-growth tech company with a market capitalization of over $648 billion. But that’s what we have with Alibaba. 
Why is BABA stock on this list? Well, when I’m looking for cheap stocks, I’m not just after names with a low price-to-earnings ratio. I also look for stocks with unique fundamentals or that are cheap relative to the company’s growth rate. 
That’s exactly what we have with Alibaba. From its peak to recent trough, shares tumbled almost 34%. Now, the price sits at over $234. But I have a rule of thumb called the “40% rule” — when a high-quality company falls 40%, it’s worth a close examination. 
Although Alibaba hasn’t quite fallen that far, it’s worth a look. Shares are down on regulatory concerns for both itself and Ant Group, the latter of which the company holds a one-third stake in. However, I see the tech firm’s current regulatory headaches as nothing more than the Chinese government flexing. This too will pass and the focus will eventually shift back to the company’s fundamentals.  
So, given its sheer dominance in China’s e-commerce space, its stellar assets, infrastructure and its growth, Alibaba is darn cheap. While at 16.7 times forward price-earnings, consensus estimates call for 37% earnings growth this year and nearly 21% next year. On the revenue front, estimates call for 48% growth this year and 30.5% next year. 

Qualcomm (QCOM)

Next on my list of cheap stocks is Qualcomm. Thanks to a massive catalyst with 5G technology, Qualcomm is set to churn out high-quality growth in the immediate future. Plus, its deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ensures that it will have dependable customers on the other end of the transaction. 
Despite this, though, the stock has been wobbly up near its new highs. Shares fell 9% in a three-day span in mid-December. Currently, the stock remains 5.7% below this month’s high, giving investors an opportunity to buy. 
The company also recently began its fiscal year 2021, where consensus estimates call for 40% revenue growth. For this, investors are currently paying just about 21 times forward price-earnings. 


					The 7 Safest Stocks to Start Off 2021 on the Right Foot				

Furthermore, although next year’s estimates call for a deceleration in growth, they still call for growth overall. Throw in the 1.73% dividend yield — almost double the 10-year Treasury yield — and Qualcomm looks attractive. 

AT&T (T)

AT&T almost always finds itself on the lists of cheap stocks to buy now. But with such a massive dividend yield and a low valuation, how can it not? 
Currently, the name pays out a yield of 7.3% — a huge yield versus fixed income and most other dividends. Moreover, the stock trades at just 9 times this year’s earnings estimates. 
With that said, though, there are some red flags.
First, T stock is down big this year, off 27.3% in 2020 while the S&P 500 is up 15.5%. Second, the company has now gone five quarters without raising its dividend. And finally, it has a ton of debt weighing in at around $170 billion. 
Now let’s address it. 
The stock has ebbed and flowed roughly between the mid-$20s to mid-$30s for the last five years. In that span, buying below $30 has generally rewarded shareholders and — without Covid-19 hitting — the stock was setting up for a move over $37 and perhaps up into the $40s. 
Of course, the choice to not raise the dividend earlier this month is surprising given that AT&T is a Dividend Aristocrat. That said, AT&T had only been raising the quarterly payout by a cent per share for the last several years. So, raising the dividend was more of an effort to keep the streak alive than anything else. Plus, at 7.3%, do we really need more yield when that extra cash flow could reduce debt? 
Speaking of debt, AT&T continues to refinance at ultra-low interest rates and is looking to divest assets outside of its core strategy. The company’s TimeWarner acquisition was expensive, but it’s a free-cash-flow machine. That will support lowering the debt and maintaining its lofty payout at a reasonable level. Finally, its HBO Max unit is now available through Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and should gain significant traction soon. 

Gogo (GOGO) 
Source: EQRoy / Shutterstock.com
	
Earlier in this article, I mentioned that special cases sometimes create a unique fundamental situation that can influence what I consider one of the “cheap stocks.” I think we have that with Gogo. 
Too often, investors are willing to overlook situations like this — they gloss over the price-earnings ratio and maybe glance at some revenue growth estimates. In Gogo’s case, shares could have a very strong 2021, should the catalysts continue to line up. 
The company essentially has two business units: commercial aviation (CA) and business aviation (BA). Recently, though, it announced the sale of its CA unit, which was a negative contributor to the bottom line and cash flow. But the risk to Gogo was that the deal wouldn’t close come early Q1. 
Well, the company let it out earlier this month that the deal has indeed closed. At its highs, shares jumped 13.4% in a single day on the news, but it has since given up those gains. It now trades just below $10. 
Getting rid of the CA unit for nothing would have been beneficial to Gogo, given its drag on the financials. Getting $400 million in cash is immensely better, however. That will allow the company some flexibility as it cleans up its balance sheet and leverages the profitable BA unit moving forward. 


					9 Long-Term Stocks for the Next Decade				

So, is this a takeout target? Perhaps. But even if it’s not, GOGO stock is cheap and worth a closer look. 
 Walgreens (WBA)
Source: saaton / Shutterstock.com
	
Getting back to cheap stocks with circumstances that are a little less unique, though, Walgreens could present some nice value to investors. In fact, WBA stock has been stuck in the mud for years, bobbling along while the rest of the market chugs higher. 
That’s not a great sales pitch, but it seems like the value is getting too hard to ignore. Shares bottomed near $33 in late October just after earnings, before taking off and temporarily clearing $44 a month later. 
Then the news of Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) pharmacy plans hit the wires and both Walgreens and CVS (NYSE:CVS) cratered. That is typical “Amazon is taking over the world” price action. When it comes down to it, though, Amazon rarely swoops in and takes all the market share. So, I don’t expect WBA’s demise to happen as a result.
All that said, the company is prepped for modest top- and bottom-line growth both this year and next year. Shares trade at a paltry 8.1 times forward earnings and pay out a 4.75% dividend yield. That leaves some meat on the bone for investors.

Ally Financial (ALLY)
Source: Shutterstock
	
This year, energy has been the worst-performing sector out there by a long shot. While the financial sector is doing much better, though, it is the second-worst performing group. However, there seems to be some value in many of the individual holdings. 
Ally Financial is one of theses — and it’s really unique. That’s because of both its valuation and its stock performance. 
Shares were hit hard in February, falling some 25% by the end of the month. Then, despite rallying 51% from its low in March, ALLY stock still ended that month significantly down from pre-pandemic prices. That speaks to the volatility it has seen this year. 
Since then, though, Ally has rallied for nine straight months. That’s rare price action even for the best-performing stocks this year. The company has crushed earnings estimates for the last two quarters and it’s days away from finishing its final quarter of fiscal 2020. Then it begins fiscal year 2021, where analysts are calling for 10% revenue growth and even better earnings. 


					7 Undervalued Stocks That Could Soar in 2021				

So, even as it is at new highs, ALLY seems like one of the cheap stocks to buy, trading at nearly 9.2 times forward earnings. On top of that, the stock trades at less than one times book value. As such, savvy investors should take a closer look at this name on a dip.

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)
Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com
	
Last but not least on my list of cheap stocks is Bristol-Myers Squibb. BMY stock continues to not get the credit I believe it deserves. 
The current company is a result of its mega-acquisition of Celgene, which Bristol-Myers got just over a year ago in late 2019 for $74 billion. This was a massive deal that generated great long-term value. 
Celgene had a low valuation, but it was not executing very well, driving that valuation even lower. That low valuation is also present in Bristol-Myers, as Wall Street forces the stock into “prove it” mode. 
Well, this company is here to do just that. 
Like many other names on this list, Bristol-Myers trades at less than 10 times forward price-earnings. Because it involves adding in Celgene’s results, comparing current-year estimates to the prior year doesn’t do much good. 
Instead, we’ll look at forward estimates. While estimates are prone to inaccuracies, analysts expect 9% revenue growth in fiscal 2021 and 17% earnings growth. And given that the company has beat on earnings estimates consistently, perhaps even these figures are conservative. 
It also helps that the stock pays out a 3.2% dividend yield. So, will Wall Street reward Bristol-Myers with a higher valuation? Who knows. But if it delivers on expectations, the company should bring great value to shareholders. 
On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in T, GOGO, AAPL and BMY.

Why Qualcomm Shares Surged Over 12% After-Hours Wednesday,finance.yahoo.com,"Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ: QCOM) shares spiked 12% during the after-hours session Wednesday. The surge came as the chipmaker said it foresees the demand for 5G smartphones to double the shipments next year, with a forecasted range between 450 million to 550 million smartphones.What Happened: Aside from smartphones, the company also expects to gain from the Internet of Things and networking gears segments, according to the Wall Street Journal.On Wednesday, Qualcomm released its financials for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended Sept. 27. GAAP revenues of $23.53 billion for fiscal 2020 fell by 3% year-over-year, whereas GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.52 were 26% higher compared to Q4 2019. This includes a $1.8 billion or $1.37 per share impact from a settlement agreement as well as certain royalties under the new global patent licensing agreement with Huawei.View more earnings on QCOMQualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said the company is '"well positioned for growth in 2021 and beyond.'"Why Does It Matter: Apple''s 5G device launches could further boost Qualcomm''s sales in the upcoming quarters, the Journal reported based on analyst consensus.The semiconductor industry is witnessing a wave of consolidation with merger agreements. Last week, reports disclosed that Marvell Technology Group Ltd (NASDAQ: MRVL) and Inphi Corporation (NASDAQ: IPHI) are in talks for a $10 billion deal. In mid-September, Nvidia Inc (NASDAQ: NVDA) bought British semiconductor company Arm Holdings for a $40 billion consideration.Price Action: After a 2.81% increase during trading hours, QCOM stock further surged 12.89% in the after-hours at $145.60 per share.Photo bt rphua on FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Jeff Bezos Sells Another B Worth Of Amazon Shares  * Spotify Rolls Out Standalone Streaming On Apple Watch App: TechCrunch(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

4 Red-Hot Growth Stocks That Should Double In 2021,finance.yahoo.com,"Despite the novel coronavirus pandemic, 2020 was a strong year for stocks, and some new growth stocks in particular. The March meltdown may have caused some investors’ ulcers to flare up. However, it paved the way for major indices such as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to hit new all-time highs in the months that followed.
So-called “stay at home” stocks such as Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) each rose more than 400%, while technology leaders such as Apple (NASDAQ:APPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw their share prices more than double on the year. So where is the growth in 2021 likely to come from? Will these stocks continue to be all-stars or will other growth stocks steal the spotlight?


					7 Short-Term Stocks To Buy for a Happy New Year  				

Many investors are betting on the “reopening play” as more people get vaccinated against Covid-19 and the U.S. economy reopens in earnest. Others are betting on a continued shift of capital into cyclical stocks. But whatever happens not all growth stocks are created equal heading into 2021. With that in mind, here are four growth stocks that could double in the next 12 months:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Coty (NYSE:COTY)
Draftkings (NASDAQ:DKNG)
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)
UPS (NYSE:UPS)

Growth Stocks That Should Double: Coty (COTY)
Source: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.com

	
At $7 a share, COTY stock is barely out of penny stock range. But despite its relatively cheap valuation, shares of the beauty retailer that specializes in fragrances, cosmetics, skin care and nail care have been rising sharply in recent months. In one five-day trading session at the end of November, Coty’s share price rose 48%. Since Oct. 1, the stock has risen 145%.
The impressive growth has been spurred by a better-than-expected earnings report that reinforced the company’s turnaround effort is succeeding. An announcement that Coty would complete the sale of its Wella professional hair care business to KKR (NYSE:KKR) also gave the share price a lift.
Specifically, Coty reported a surprise profit for its fiscal first quarter, announced on Nov. 4. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of 11 cents, compared to the 5 cents-per-share loss analysts had forecasted. The surprise profit was also a vote of confidence in Coty’s new Chief Executive Officer, Sue Nabi, who is the company’s third CEO in a year.
Wall Street is now hopeful that Sue Nabi is taking Coty in the right direction after several failed turnaround attempts for the cosmetics company that has been in business since 1904. COTY stock got a further boost when it was announced that a 60% stake it had in Wella would be sold to KKR for $2.5 billion by the end of November. Coty will retain the remaining 40% stake it has in Wella and has said that it plans to “use $2 billion of the proceeds to pay down debt.” All of these steps position Coty for continued success in 2021.

Draftkings (DKNG)

With the widespread distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine, sports should really comeback in 2021. We’re talking about all sports — college football, March Madness, the Olympics and so on. Professional basketball, baseball, football and hockey should welcome fans back to stadiums and resume their regular schedules. And it all bodes well for sports betting operator Draftkings.
The company, which went public via a special acquisition deal (SPAC) in June 2020, has seen its share price rise 29% in the past six months to $53.90. But this past year has been extremely difficult on the world of sports and Draftkings’ core business of betting on sports. Many of Draftkings’ most lucrative sports events, such as March Madness, were cancelled this past year. That thrust DKNG stock’s future into question, but it has managed to stay strong this year regardless.

In 2021, DKNG stock should do much better. Not only will most major sporting events resume as normal in the New Year, but there are growing expectations that more U.S. states will legalize sports betting in coming months. Analysts at Oppenheimer recently noted that many states face revenue shortfalls due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and, as budget deficits swell, they may turn to sports betting as a new revenue source. Oppenheimer expects New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Ohio to legalize sports betting in the coming year. That would certainly help lift DKNG stock to new heights.

Qualcomm (QCOM)

Despite its spotty roll out to date, 5G wireless is here and will become the dominant form of connectivity moving forward. And several companies are positioned to capitalize on the 5G revolution that is expected to take society into new technological realms.
Qualcomm is one of the companies that will most likely reap rewards from 5G. The semiconductor and software manufacturer is benefiting from the use of its microchips in various 5G wireless technologies and platforms. In particular, Qualcomm chips are being inserted into a growing number of 5G Android cell phones. Qualcomm isn’t just at the forefront of the 5G revolution, it is making the 5G revolution possible.
The massive potential of 5G is reflected in the growth of QCOM stock. Qualcomm’s share price has more than doubled since March 2020, up 144% at $147.42 a share. And analysts see big things ahead for the stock. Morgan Stanley named Qualcomm as one of 10 stocks best positioned to benefit from the global 5G roll out. Other analysts that cover the company have a median price target of $165 a share on Qualcomm’s stock, with a high estimate of $200.
Given the continued roll out and adoption of 5G networks and technologies around the world, the coming year looks very bright for Qualcomm and its shareholders.

UPS (UPS)

Not only is UPS still benefitting from people ordering online while sheltering at home, but the delivery and logistics company is also poised to reap benefits from the massive roll out of Covid-19 vaccines across the United States and around the world. This is the time for companies such as UPS to shine, and the Atlanta, Georgia-based company is doing just that.
UPS is ramping up its operations and working double time to meet unprecedented demand and help all of us get through the global pandemic. These efforts have helped UPS stock reach new highs, up 113% since March at $175.18 a share.
Heading into 2021, UPS has momentum on its side. The company saw strong gains in its third quarter earnings. Specifically, the company’s revenue grew by 16% year-over-year to $21.2 billion and its earnings per share were up 10% at $2.28 a share. This beat analyst expectations for EPS of $1.90 a share. While UPS declined to provide forward guidance on its earnings, the company has aggressively expanded its North American operations throughout 2020.


					9 Strong-Performing Stocks To Sell Before The End of The Year				

In Canada, for example, UPS has opened a new $800 million package sorting and delivery hub. The company has also hired more than 5,000 employees amid the pandemic. As such, the company shows no signs of slowing down heading into the New Year.

7 Long-Term Stocks To Buy You’ll Want To Hang Onto,finance.yahoo.com,"When you start hearing about day trading at volume, you know the markets have gotten frothy and buying and holding long-term stocks isn’t a top priority for investors. But times like these are precisely when it should be. Trying to time trades is tricky business, even for Wall Street bigshots who have been trading for decades with state of the art equipment and a lifetime of institutional knowledge – and occasionally an advanced degree in mathematics. Trying to outsmart these people or play their game over the long term might be entertaining, but if your goal is to make money, I wouldn’t bother. Finding companies with solid fundamentals in key industries and buying for the long-term might be boring, but it makes money.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Here are 7 long-term stocks to buy you’ll want to hang onto: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Clorox (NYSE:CLX) JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) Sony (NYSE:SNE) These companies deserve your attention for the future because of how well they’ve handled the past. Long-term Stocks To Buy: Amazon (AMZN) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com There are few companies that can turn into a global retail brand the way AMZN has done. From a humble online bookseller in the 1990s to market juggernaut in just three decades, Amazon has been on quite the journey. Now it’s hard for most Americans to imagine a day that doesn’t somehow involve an Amazon product. Whole Foods for grocery shopping (if you’re not buying supplies off its website). Prime for watching shows and movies. Of course, its bread-and-butter retail and logistics operations. And of course, cloud computing behemoth Amazon Web Services provides plenty of cash to keep all its new and existing ventures running. When the pandemic hit, everyone realized how valuable AMZN had become. But its value is much more now, as it holds a nearly $1.6 trillion market cap. It is kind of a one-stock index of the entire modern economy. If you’re a long-term bull on the U.S., AMZN is a long-term stock for you. Up 70% in the past year, its pace may vary but its continued growth isn’t in question. Clorox (CLX) Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com This company’s beginnings stand almost in direct opposition to that of AMZN. CLX made one product, bleach, for nearly 50 years and built a big business out of it. Now more than 100 years old, CLX has diversified its product line a bit, though not significantly. Now it has a portfolio of around 50 brands that are sold in over 100 countries. Reliable names like Glad, Handi Wipes, Liquid-Plumr, Pine-Sol and Tilex along with its titular Clorox line. This is a classic long-term US stock. During the pandemic, cleaning and disinfecting products have been in high demand at home and abroad. CLX stock remains rock solid. And that’s to be expected after growing through two World Wars, the Great Depression and everything else that has come its way. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon Up 24% in the past 12 months, it’s still trading at a P/E of 21 — below the average forward P/E of the S&P 500 — with plenty of growth ahead. JD.com (JD) Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com The growth of digital channels in the U.S. is mirrored in China, where its domestic market is almost an order of magnitude larger than U.S. market. The potential is huge. Also, the Chinese market operates a bit differently than the U.S. Large companies tend to work with each other to leverage their most important assets rather than try to compete head to head. But they also diversify. For example, JD is like the AMZN of China (and other Asian nations). It has expanded into logistics, AI, fintech and other sectors. Yet for all of its strength, it trades at one-tenth the market cap of AMZN and that’s after a 127% run in the past 12 months. Certainly there’s some trade risk here, as the U.S. threatens to delist Chinese firms from U.S. exchanges, but JD is far down that list. This is a top long-term stock for the China’s and Asia’s consumers. PayPal (PYPL) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com This is the company that launched Elon Musk before he became the maverick CEO we all know today. Even back then Musk was a handful, getting deposed as CEO after a couple years but still holding more stock than anyone else when eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) purchased PYPL in 2002. That became the seed capital for Musk’s later ventures. But beyond the personality, PYPL is a pioneer in electronic payments and now in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments with its Venmo app. Time and again Wall Street has dismissed PYPL as not having the kind of financial reputation or muscle to take on the big financial institutions in the digital space. And time and again, PYPL has proven them wrong. The past year has been a boon for PYPL’s model and has showed that big banks weren’t altogether ready for the quick and massive shift to digital. And PYPL now has credit services as well as other payment platforms. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon The stock is up over 113% in the past 12 months and it’s now here to stay. Qualcomm (QCOM) Source: jejim / Shutterstock.com We’re well ensconced in the Mobility Age at this point. By that I mean what started as the digital revolution has now moved to the point where wireless networks keep us connected nearly all the time, much to some people’s chagrin. But the fact is, despite the downsides, there are plenty of upsides too. And now that 5G telecom tech is upon us, data will be flowing even faster than before. One the beneficiaries and leaders in pushing digital mobility further is QCOM, one of the world’s leading telecom companies. Its business model is unique because it develops chips and telecom equipment but makes money licensing the technology for others to manufacture and also taking a cut of sales. Both U.S. and Chinese (and others) phone makers rely on state of the art QCOM chips, especially for 5G. QCOM just signed a new deal to rekindle relations with Chinese phone makers earlier this week. As long as mobility is a thing, this is a long-term stock to own. The stock is up 75% in the past 12 months, yet the stock is trading at a P/E of 35. Shopify (SHOP) Source: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com With unemployment nearing 6.7% and many states admitting that the pandemic has hampered their ability to accurately count the unemployed, there are a lot of Americans trying to figure out how to bring in a paycheck. Many have turned to driving Uber or Lyft, although passenger numbers are down significantly now as well. And taxis are even worse. That has led many to try their hands at turning their hobbies into businesses. And that’s where SHOP comes in. It’s a cloud-based platform that helps small and mid-sized business build out professional websites. The stock is up nearly 1000% over the past three years, and much of that has come in the past two years, as the economy has slowed. Vaccines may be on the way, and the government is working through another stimulus package, but the damage done to the economy has yet to be seen clearly given all the other issues facing the nation. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon This stock is up 167% in the past year and has plenty of potential growth ahead. Sony (SNE) Source: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com Launched in 1946 in Japan, SNE has been known to every generation since for various electronics. For decades, SNE made the best televisions in the world after launching the first all-transistor television in 1959 and taking the global television market by storm. Then came the video generation. Then the Walkman generation, when SNE defined personal, portable music. And now, it’s the PlayStation videogame system. Along the way, it has moved into the entertainment industry, on both the content and equipment sides. Its contributions to our electronic era are practically too numerous to list and Sony continues to be a formidable player. The thing is, it generally cuts a low profile. SNE stock is currently up more than 43% in the past 12 months, yet trades at a P/E below 15. This durable, quality electronics firm may not garner headlines, but it still is a revered and important brand, generation after generation.

Intel's High-End 10th-Gen Desktop Processors Have Hit the 14nm Limit,gizmodo.com,"How much can Intel squeeze out of its 14nm architecture? A lot, surprisingly, especially since things didn’t go as planned for its 10nm process. After six years on the same process, and five on the same architecture, this latest round of desktop processors still manages to make a few changes, most notably a thinner die STIM (solder thermal interface material) that helps improve thermal performance, and a boost clock of up to 5.3GHz on its highest-end CPU, the Core i9-10900K. But when you run the benchmarks and compare it to other processors on the market, it’s clear that Intel has reached its limit with 14nm. After all this time Intel really will need to find a way to move on to a smaller transistor architecture (probably 7nm at this point) if it wants to compete with AMD.",https://gizmodo.com/intel-core-i9-10900k-and-core-i5-10600k-review-the-14n-1843540636,2020-06-11T14:50:00+00:00

AMD's best Big Navi GPU may only be a match for Nvidia Ampere's second tier,pcgamer.com,"The flagship AMD Big Navi RDNA 2 graphics card is reportedly set to deliver performance on par with the RTX 2080 Ti, and to be launched as a direct competitor to the Nvidia Ampere-based GeForce RTX 3080. That&apos;s potentially significant because it means AMD is not expecting to take on the top-end RTX 3080 Ti from Nvidia when it launches its own enthusiast-class GPUs.This comes from a report by Coreteks, which suggests AMD has been sharing fresh details about the next generation of Radeon cards with its add-in board partners (AIBs). It claims the top RDNA 2 GPU, fishily codenamed Sienna Cichlid, will bat around the same level as the RTX 2080 Ti, though in best-case scenarios it could beat it by as much as 15% in terms of gaming performance.As ever such a &apos;best-case&apos; will be in the select few games which have specific AMD optimisations, and traditionally offer higher frame rates against comparative GeForce GPUs.This level of performance is expected to pit the top Big Navi card against the RTX 3080, with the AMD Radeon card likely to be priced to undercut the second-tier Nvidia Ampere GPU as it will be launched later. And we all know how much AMD loves a price war...There have been many performance rumours leading up to this year&apos;s launch of AMD&apos;s Big Navi cards, some conflicting, and none of them that we can actually point to and say &apos;this is definitely correct.&apos; We are getting closer, and if this really is coming from the AIBs then there it feels like it has a bit more of an of authority.But still, it&apos;s anonymous and therefore has to be treated with as much skepticism as everything else that&apos;s surfaced about the next-gen Radeon GPUs. Right now, the performance rumours range from Big Navi destroying the top Ampere card to only taking on its second-tier offering.&#xA0;This latest report, however, claims that there will be a reveal event in early September for the new AMD RDNA 2 cards, with a release date on October 7. With the Nvidia Ampere release date rumoured to be September 17, and sampling suggested to occur late August, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see AMD aiming to spoil the launch with its own reveal just ahead of it.&#xA0;We may even see AMD releasing some speculative pricing ahead of the Ampere launch, which are then miraculously lower by the time Big Navi launches. The &apos;jebait&apos; situation around the RX 5700 XT launch was all kinds of weird, but I don&apos;t doubt something like that could happen again, especially with such a closely timed launch period.",https://www.pcgamer.com/au/amd-big-navi-rdna-2-aimed-at-rtx-3080/,2020-07-30T11:28:52+00:00

AMD Ryzen 4000 APUs in short supply says XPG... suggests Intel is better anyways,pcgamer.com,"Laptop and desktop manufacturer XPG has suggested that AMD is facing shortages for Renoir APUs. In a post over on the official XPG support forum, the XPG_gg brand account outlines that it may face difficulty building systems around the Ryzen 7 4800H due to a delay in shipments until September.&quot;On July 31 we received an announcement from our ODM that we are facing a serious CPU shortage from AMD in Q3 2020,&quot; the Reddit post reads. &quot;Large orders that have recently been confirmed to be shipped from our ODM in the middle and end of August are now supposed to be delayed until the end of September. This is explained by a serious uptick in demand from larger brands and by what we assume bottlenecks in AMD&apos;s production capacities.&quot;Upon receiving this news on Friday (July 31), we reached out to our corporate contacts in AMD who confirmed that this is an industry-wide shortage and there is no way around it. We currently have an order backlog with our ODM on Ryzen 7 4800H of over 1,600 units. Both AMD and our ODM have confirmed that our demand has been allocated (meaning: we will get those CPUs), but the goods won&apos;t reach our ODM before End of September.&quot;The post appears to be a legitimate in that it&apos;s from an XPG employee and official account.It&apos;s hard to gauge the extent of any such shortage on the worldwide supply or the availability of Ryzen 7 4800H laptops. XPG attributes the shortage to TSMC&apos;s tight supply and the popularity of AMD&apos;s latest Zen 2 processors with all laptop manufacturers. That would suggest some manufacturers may be affected more so than others&#x2014;those that placed their orders early.The Reddit post (via Igor&apos;s Lab) is surprisingly candid for a manufacturer. At one point it devolves into a rant into AMD versus Intel and suggests AMD is a weaker proposition due to driver support, slower gaming performance, and fewer GPU lanes.&#xA0;The post sure doesn&apos;t read like a company hoping for a closer relationship with AMD, and it&apos;s not like Intel hasn&apos;t seen its fair share of supply chain constraints as of late.",https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/amd-ryzen-4000-apus-in-short-supply-says-xpg-suggests-intel-is-better-anyways/,2020-08-03T15:43:27+00:00

AMD says Smart Access Memory isn't proprietary it's just it only works on AMD hardware right now,pcgamer.com,"AMD says its Smart Access Memory isn&apos;t proprietary and isn&apos;t only locked into working with its own Ryzen 5000-series CPUs and Radeon RX 6000-series GPUs. It&apos;s just that it hasn&apos;t yet worked with any other hardware vendors to enable it, though it welcomes the opportunity to do so.This comes after Nvidia spilled AMD&apos;s beans about what exactly the Smart Access Memory (SAM) feature of its new Big Navi graphics cards was built on, and explained that base technology wasn&apos;t restricted to PCIe 4.0 hardware, or indeed AMD-only hardware.&#xA0;It was a weird switcheroo where AMD was the company seemingly creating a performance-boosting feature that was entirely locked down to its own hardware ecosystem, and then only it&apos;s latest silicon. Which left Nvidia&#x2014;the company traditionally pilloried for such tactics&#x2014;acting as the bastion of open standards and promising to soon open up a similar feature for its own graphics cards as well as AMD-rival, Intel&apos;s PC platform.&#xA0;But it only seemed as though AMD was locking its SAM feature down to its own new hardware because that was all it was going to actually work on. At least at launch.&#xA0;AMD has now released a statement explaining that yes, Smart Access Memory is based on the Resizable BAR PCIe, and yes, it can work with other hardware, but it&apos;s currently only been working on validating it with the Ryzen 5000 and Radeon RX 6000 pairings.&#x201C;As the only company offering high performance gaming CPUs and GPUs, AMD is in a unique position to deliver incredible PC gaming experiences,&quot; reads the statement. &quot;With AMD Smart Access Memory, we have designed, optimized and validated both hardware and software technologies with all combinations of Ryzen 5000 Series processors, Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards, AMD 500 Series motherboards and the latest drivers and BIOS at launch. We believe this pairing unlocks maximum platform performance.&quot;Smart Access Memory is built on features of the PCIe standard and firmware standards (Resizable BAR), and was developed through extensive validation and platform optimization.

Fresh AMD RX 6800 XT reference cards 'expected to be available in the first quarter of 2021',pcgamer.com,"AMD will deliver more reference RX 6000-series designs before the end of March, senior director at Radeon Technologies Group Ritche Corpus tells BabelTechReviews in an interview. While only briefly touching on the subject of GPU stock, Corpus says AMD expects the popular reference design will make a return sometime in the first quarter of 2021.&#xA0;The AMD RX 6900 XT and AMD RX 6800 XT share the same reference cooler, a chunky triple-fan design in black and red garb. The lower-spec AMD RX 6800 opts for a slightly pared-down variant. All three have proven themselves more than capable for cooling the Navi 21 GPU beneath&#x2014;they&apos;re surprisingly quiet for reference designs, too.&#xA0;So when it came out that AMD wasn&apos;t planning to continue production beyond the initial batch, it was met with disappointment. Disappointment not only for the cooler&apos;s unique design going away but for the loss of a competent chiller at MSRP pricing.The AMD RX 6800 is priced at $579, and the RX 6800 XT at $649. The RX 6900 XT is $999. All three are available in reference garb for that same price, while many third-party designs are priced above MSRP. Sometimes well above MSRP given the slight supply and high demand.The decision to cease production of the reference design wouldn&apos;t stick, however. AMD went back on the announcement that same day, stating it would be extending the cooler&apos;s life indefinitely going forward due to popular demand.Now, it seems, we&apos;re going to see the first of those cards available for purchase from AMD&apos;s own webstore.",https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-rx-6000-series-reference-graphics-card-shipment/,2021-02-03T15:29:59+00:00

"Should Microsoft Try To Acquire AMD, Nvidia or Micron In 2021?",finance.yahoo.com,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a survey to collect sentiment on what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. This week we posed the following question to over 1,000 traders and investors about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT): Over the next year, should Microsoft try to acquire AMD, Nvidia or Micron? Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) Buy none Microsoft develops and licenses consumer and enterprise software. It is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. The company is organized into three main segments: productivity and business processes (Microsoft Office, cloud-based Office 365, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype, LinkedIn, Dynamics), intelligence cloud (infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings Azure, Windows Server OS, SQL Server) and personal computing (Windows Client, Xbox, Bing search, display advertising, Surface laptops, tablets and desktops). At time of publication Microsoft’s market cap measures in at $1.83 trillion. For context, this figure exceeds the combined market caps of Nvidia ($336 billion), AMD ($106 billion) and Micron ($90 billion) three times over. See Also: How To Buy Microsoft Stock. Our survey found 32% percent of respondents saying Microsoft should move forward on an M&A with AMD in 2021. AMD designs and produces microprocessors for the computer and consumer electronics industries. The majority of the firm''s sales are in CPUs and graphics processing units. Many traders and investors were vocal in their support of AMD, saying it has time and again proven itself with its processors and GPUs in the gaming industry. Respondents said AMD should be seriously considered as a top M&A contender with Microsoft, as the two tech companies have had several prior partnerships, including a recent Xbox Series X|S project which integrates full AMD RDNA 2 architecture. Next, 28% of traders and investors responded that Microsoft should complete an M&A with Nvidia this year. Nvidia is a leading designer of GPUs. The company’s chips are used in a variety of markets, including high-end PCs for gaming, in a GPU-accelerated AI shopping tool for Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and for autonomous driving tech in many Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) electric vehicles. Respondents in this group cited Nvidia as an essential developer and leader in future chipmaking that has made a name for itself in the auto and bio-intelligence industries. An Nvidia acquisition would immediately bolster Microsoft’s mobile computing units. Only 6% of traders and investors saw a Microsoft-Micron M&A making sense during 2021. Respondents said Microsoft should look to acquire Micron’s ultra-bandwidth solutions, which are known to deliver maximum bandwidth to feed client’s data-hungry workloads like high-performance computing, artificial intelligence systems and professional visualization workstations, as traders believe these fields will continue to spike in demand amid a transition to long-term remote working conditions. Finally, 30% said Microsoft should not acquire any of the three companies. It’s worth noting that several respondents who were opposed to these M&As believed the Redmond-based tech giant would be better served focusing on research, development of cloud-based tech and a possible M&A in the cloud sector. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 1000 adults.

These leaked AMD Zen 4 server specs have us salivating for Ryzen 6000,pcgamer.com,"Claimed specifications for AMD&apos;s upcoming EPYC server processors, codename Genoa, have been published. They show these truly next-gen chips sporting heaps of new technologies, including DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 lanes, and all of which has us practically salivating at what may be planned for Ryzen 6000 and the future of our gaming PCs.The news comes from Twitter leaker ExecutableFix, who has a pretty good track record when it comes to AMD information.&#xA0;Saying that, don&apos;t take them as gospel just yet. Even if they are quite exciting.It&apos;s looking like the next AMD server chip will come with up to 96 cores, for 192 threads in total with simultaneous multithreading; DDR5-5200, with up to 12 channels; 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes; a 320W TDP, which can increase to 400W per chip with cTDP options; and the SP5 socket, which comes with a whopping 6,096 pins in a land grid array configuration.Jam your digits into this socket and you&apos;ll be straightening bent pins for days.That&apos;s all built using the yet unannounced and still top secret Zen 4 CPU architecture, which is sure to be one and the same with what&apos;s destined on desktop with future generations of AMD Ryzen CPUs.The benefits of DDR5 are set to be more immediately beneficial to gamers than, say, PCIe 5.0 capabilities. We&apos;ve hardly a device that maxes out the PCIe 4.0 standard introduced with the Zen 2 architecture so far, and only SSDs currently make the cut.",https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-epyc-genoa-zen-4-specs-ryzen/,2021-03-01T12:56:56+00:00

"Jim Cramer On Tesla Upgrade, Salesforce''s Slack Acquisition",finance.yahoo.com,"CNBC''s Jim Cramer shared his first thoughts on the market Thursday, covering an upgrade on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the acquisition of Slack Technologies (NYSE: WORK) by Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE: CRM).Cramer on Tesla: Goldman Sachs upgraded shares of Tesla from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $455 to $780.'"I felt the guy''s pain,'" Cramer said on upgrading shares.The Goldman Sachs price target is the highest of all analysts right now. It comes after the bank downgraded Tesla in June on demand concerns. The bank said Wednesday they were '"incorrect.'"Cramer called the analyst note a '"tough situation to upgrade up here.'"Related Link: Tesla''s Valuation Easier To Justify As Tech Company, Not AutoCramer on Salesforce: Cramer shared his thoughts on Salesforce and the stock falling off after announcing its $27 billion acquisition of Slack.'"Slack had a great quarter, took in a lot of customers,'" Cramer said.He said Salesforce can now take on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) with the deal: I think you have to do it.'"Cramer said this deal is a way for Salesforce to become a $500 billion company. He said Salesforce can help Slack do three times the amount of sales it''s currently doing.Slack now has a bundling case against Microsoft, said Cramer, and he''s '"very surprised people aren''t even looking at how well Slack is doing.'"Price Action: Shares of Tesla are up 4% to $590.71 in pre-market trading Thursday. Salesforce shares are up 2% to $225.96.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why Sony''s PlayStation 5 Is Winning What Could Be The Last Console War  * Discovery+ Streaming Platform Could Win Big With Strong Brand, Content Library(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Jim Cramer: Salesforce Has 100% Upside After Buying Slack,finance.yahoo.com,"Salesforce.com, inc.''s (NYSE: CRM) $27.7-billion acquisition of Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK) has received some pushback from analysts, but CNBC''s Jim Cramer says the deal is '"brilliant'" and will double Salesforce''s stock.What Happened: Salesforce has shown impressive growth over the years to the point where it is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial and boasts a valuation of more than $200 billion.Due to the '"law of large numbers,'" it would be very difficult for Salesforce to organically expand to become a $500-billion company, Cramer said.Related Link: 6 Salesforce Analysts React To Slack Deal: ''Game-Changer Potential''The problem for Salesforce is that it is a mostly '"invisible'" product that people don''t interact with, the CNBC host said, adding that the only exceptions are data scientists and people who work in sales and live off the Salesforce platform.This is where Slack''s platform comes into play, as it''s messaging platform that''s '"visible'" and '"something everyone can see and something everyone can buy,'" Cramer said.Why It''s Important: Salesforce''s largest acquisition to date will create a stronger entity better positioned to compete with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Cramer said. Salesforce sells enterprise customer relationship management software that rivals Microsoft, while Slack is a direct competitor to Microsoft Teams, he said. '"If you follow the customer, you''ll understand why Salesforce.com, which built a gigantic business by helping clients harness the power of the cloud, decided to shell out $27.7 billion for Slack Technologies in a deal that was widely criticized.'" What''s Next: Salesforce expects the deal to close in its new fiscal year that starts in February.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Cramer On Layoffs At 3M, Elsewhere: Investors Must Separate ''Stocks From People''  * Warner Bros.

"Bill Gates On Investing In Bitcoin: ''If You Have Less Money Than Elon, You Should Probably Watch Out''",finance.yahoo.com,"Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates is not bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and is cautioning others to reconsider such investments — unless they have more money than Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. What Happened: Gates told Bloomberg on Monday that he isn’t worried about Musk’s Bitcoin randomly going up or down. “Elon has tons of money and he is very sophisticated,” the tech entrepreneur said, adding that he is more concerned about people getting into such manias who don’t have as much money to spare. “If you have less money than Elon, you should probably watch out,” Gates told Bloomberg. See also: How To Buy Microsoft Stock The philanthropist explained that he is not keen on Bitcoin, primarily because of the amount of electricity it consumes and the promotion of irreversible anonymous transactions. and that he is more enthusiastic about digital currencies. “Digital money is a good thing,” Gates said, claiming the difference lies in terms of being regulatory-compliant and still giving the convenience and low-cost associated with cryptocurrency transactions. Why It Matters: Gates told CNBC last week that he was “neutral” on Bitcoin and acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s role in bringing down transaction costs. Gates also showered praises on Musk in a New York Times podcast, dubbing the entrepreneur''s work with Tesla '"one of the greatest contributions to climate change anyone’s ever made.'" Musk has been increasingly tweeting about cryptocurrencies this year, in particular, the joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE). The Tesla CEO’s tweets often move markets and several people, including those in the cryptocurrency community, have expressed concern over such statements from the world’s second-richest person. The electric vehicle maker also announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin this month, but Musk said the move wasn’t '"directly reflective of my opinion.” Price Action: Bitcoin traded 14.3% lower at $47.906.71 at press time on Tuesday. Tesla shares are down 3.8% in the pre-market session at $687.

"Beyond WallStreetBets, Analyst Sees GameStop Benefiting From These 3 Factors",finance.yahoo.com,"GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has yet to show financial success in an industry that is rapidly shifting to digital and its current valuation “far exceeds our high fundamental expectations” but there are factors favoring the videogame retailer, according to analysts at Telsey Advisory Group. The GameStop Analyst: Telsey reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and maintained a price target of $33. GameStop is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after the markets close on Tuesday. See also: How‌ ‌to‌ ‌Buy‌ ‌GameStop‌ ‌(GME)‌ ‌Stock‌ The GameStop Thesis: The analysts expect GameStop to benefit from the new gaming cycle, with current demand outpacing supply for new generation Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE) consoles. GameStop is also expected to benefit from its agreement with RC Ventures and the board refresh as well as its healthy balance sheet with a net cash position of $101 million at the end of the fiscal 2020 third quarter. See Also: GameStop Put On PS5, Xbox Series X For Sale But The Stock Didn''t Last Long Fourth-Quarter Expectations: The analysts expect GameStop’s fourth-quarter sales to decline 3% year-over-year to $2.13 billion, on comparable sales growth of 4.5%. GameStop E-Commerce Transformation: GameStop said in early March that its board has constituted a strategic planning and capital allocation committee to zero in on initiatives to aid its business transformation. The committee, chaired by major shareholder and Chewy, Inc. (NYSE: CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen will focus on transforming the company into a technology business. Cohen, through his RC Ventures, owns about a 13% stake in GameStop. Since its institution, the committee has appointed GameStop’s first-ever chief technology officer to oversee the company’s digital business and technology functions. Led by Cohen, GameStop is expected to adopt a digital business and transform from a brick-and-mortar business model. Price Action: GameStop shares closed almost 0.8% higher on Wednesday at $209.81.

"With Tesla Stock Decline, Elon Musk Lost $27B In A Week",finance.yahoo.com,"Tesla stock fell 11.5% in a week. This decline cost very dearly to its main shareholder, Elon Musk. Tech stocks were those paying the highest price in terms of performance on Wall Street last month. Nasdaq fell 6.7% and has virtually zeroed gains year to date (+0.25%). Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which entered the S&P 500 index in December, is still one of the tech stocks par excellence on Wall Street. Premise: Tesla gained 743% in 2020. Report: the stock lost 30.7% in the last month, falling from $863 to $597. Tesla founder Elon Musk, who owns approximately 18% of the company''s shares, was the most affected by the stock decline. $27 Billion Less For Musk: In just one week, Elon Musk lost $27 billion (in terms of stock value, not the money held by Musk in his bank account) due to an 11.5% drop in Tesla shares. The data comes from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Just to give an idea, such loss is equivalent to the total assets of James Dyson, the 52nd richest man in the world and the founder of the company that bears his name. The same index also reports that Musk now lags a whopping $157 billion behind Jeff Bezos (who leads the ranking) and keeps Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Bill Gates at a distance of $22 billion. Tesla Ranks 7th By Market Cap: Since the beginning of this year, Tesla has moved from fifth to seventh place among the companies with the largest capitalization, surpassing by Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B). However, CNN Business notes that despite Tesla''s decline, 2021 could also prove very profitable for Elon Musk, who should receive further billion-dollar bonuses for the purchase of additional Tesla shares - based on the results achieved. So far, Musk has never sold Tesla shares and does not receive a salary from the company he founded, but his compensation is paid in bonuses for the purchase of shares to be paid upon achieving certain goals.
